# discord hacker kit
Discord pentesting project, created to demonstrate possible techniques attackers could use, created in an effort to promote greater security on the platform. Simple script to send a usertoken to a webhook, then another script to login with it (educational and pentesting purposes only, I do not condone using either of these scripts on people).
